- **Never create a file longer than 500 lines of code.** If a file approaches this limit, refactor by splitting it into modules or helper files.

- **Organize code into clearly separated modules**, grouped by feature or responsibility.

- **Use clear, consistent imports** (prefer relative imports within packages).

- Add new sub-tasks or TODOs discovered during development to `TASK.md` under a “Discovered During Work” section.
