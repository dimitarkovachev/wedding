- **Always create unit tests for new features** (functions, classes, routes, etc).

- **After updating any logic**, check whether existing unit tests need to be updated. If so, do it.

- **Tests should live in a file in the same folder as the file under test with the same name with suffix '_test'** mirroring the main app structure.
  - Include at least:
    - 1 test for expected use
    - 1 edge case
    - 1 failure case
