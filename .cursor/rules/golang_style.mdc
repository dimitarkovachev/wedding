- **Use golang** as the primary language.

- Enforce standard Go conventions via `golint` and `go fmt`

- Use Go Modules (go.mod, go.sum) strictly.

- Pin versions and avoid using replace directives unless absolutely needed.

- Run go mod tidy as part of CI.

- 60% test coverage minimum (unit + integration).

- Use table-driven tests for logic-heavy rules.

- Integrate go test ./... -cover into CI/CD.

- Global logging setup using `logrus`.

- No fmt.Println for debugging in production code.

- Include structured logs with context (e.g., cursorID, userID)

- Input validation must be centralized.

- Sanitize data if user-controlled input is processed.

- Avoid panic propagation — always return errors up the chain.

- Use `uber fx` for APIs and `gorm` for ORM if applicable.

- Never inline if statements with errors
